--Pseudocode #1--
//Ask the user to input text "Hello World!"
  INPUT = Hello World!

IF INPUT isn't Hello World! (eg. HELLO WORLD!, H3ll0 W0r1d!)
  Loop back to ask the user for the Input

ELSE
  Convert INPUT to have all caps

PRINT the Output
--Pseudocode #2--
//Ask the user to input two numbers
INPUT1 = x
INPUT2 = y
RESULT = z

Enter the first number (x): 10
Enter the second number (y): 12

// Calculate to add the numbers
x + y = z

//Output the result
The Total number is (RESULT)

--Pseudocode #3--
// Ask the user for a number each number is randomized between 0 and user input's number, if user doesn't ask for another, add all of them.
Enter the MAX Number: 100

// Ask the computer to display a random number between 0 and the user's input.

OUTPUT: 54

Another number? (Y/N) Y

Random Number: 22
IF User inputs N
  Add numbers to the total result and display.
ELSE User inputs Y
  Output a random number between 0 and the User input's number.

--Pseudocode #5--
// Print numbers RIGHT if they're even, if not print LEFT
EVEN = RIGHT
ODD = LEFT

// Ask the computer to randomly generate list of numbers.

// Calculate to see if Code is even or odd
IF number MOD 2 == 0 THEN
        number is EVEN
    ELSE
        The number is ODD

// Display random set of 10 numbers
IF number is Even: display the Output as "RIGHT"

IF number is Odd: display the Output as "LEFT"

Display the total amount of RIGHT and LEFT
RIGHT: 3
LEFT: 7
